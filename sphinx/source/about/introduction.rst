Introduction
============

This page aims at giving a broad presentation of the tool and of the contents of this documentation, so that you know
where to start if you are a beginner or where to look if you need info on a specific feature.

About the documentation
-----------------------

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited and revamped by members of the dotProfile team and
community. It is edited via text files in the `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the open source
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.

.. note:: You can contribute to dotProfiles's documentation by opening issues through

            or sending patches via pull requests on its GitHub
            `source repository <https://github.com/WellFiredDevelopment/dotProfileDocumentation.git>`_.

Organisation of the documentation
---------------------------------

This documentation is organised in five sections, the way it is split up should be relatively intuitive:

- The :ref:`sec-general` section contains this introduction as well as general information on the tool It also contains
  the :ref:`doc_faq`.
- The :ref:`sec-learn` section is the the main entry point of this documentation, as it contains all the necessary
  information on using the tool. It starts with the :ref:`Step by step<toc-learn-step_by_step>` tutorial which should be
  the entry point for all new users.
- Finally, the :ref:`sec-class-ref` is the documentation of the dotProfile API. It is generated automatically from a
  files in the main repository, and the generated files of the documentation are therefore not meant to be modified.
