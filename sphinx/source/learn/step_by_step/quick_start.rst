Quick Start
===========

.Profile is built to be incredibly easy to use, in here, you're going to find two sections, one will get you running
with no work, and the other is a bit more manual, but provides you more control.

Quickest Start
--------------
Simply add the script Bootstrap.cs to a game object in your scene, this will automatically create a fully functioning
Profile, that tracks a lot of data, you can toggle the profile visual display by pressing the A key, you should be
presented with an overview of performance metrics ...

If that's all you need, you're now done, you can ship your product to customers and they'll be able to visualise
performance data, your internal QA team can use it to track performance across a number of devices, or you can use it
yourself to get high on your supremely optimised code.
